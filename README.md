# Verilog Codes

This repository contains Verilog code examples showcasing both **behavioral modeling** and **structural modeling** for various digital circuits. The code is organized into different folders, each containing designs for specific components and systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **4 bit ripple adder**  
   Verilog code for a 4-bit ripple carry adder using both behavioral and structural modeling techniques.

2. **ALU**  
   Code for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs various arithmetic and logical operations.

3. **Counters**  
   Verilog code for different types of counters, including up, down, and up-down counters.

4. **Flip Flops**  
   Contains Verilog code for various flip-flops such as D Flip-Flop, T Flip-Flop, JK Flip-Flop, and SR Flip-Flop.

5. **Full adder**  
   A full adder implementation in Verilog, showing both behavioral and structural approaches.

6. **MUX**  
   Verilog code for different types of multiplexers (MUX), including 2-to-1, 4-to-1, etc.

7. **Priority encoder**  
   Verilog code for implementing a priority encoder, which encodes the position of the highest input bit.

8. **Ram**  
   Verilog code for implementing Random Access Memory (RAM) with basic read/write functionality.

9. **Vending Machine**  
   A simple vending machine state machine implemented in Verilog.

10. **Router 1x3**  
    Verilog code for a router that routes data packets from a single 8-bit input to one of three output channels.

## Usage

To use the Verilog codes in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verilog-codes.git

2. Navigate to the folder containing the desired design:
   cd verilog-codes/ALU

3. You can open the Verilog files in any Verilog simulator or IDE (e.g., ModelSim, Vivado, etc.) to simulate and test the design.
